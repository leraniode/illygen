## [v0.1.1] — 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- `engine.Run` no longer panics when passed a `nil` Context — treated as empty
- `KnowledgeStore.Add` now returns an error for empty `id` or `domain` instead of silently storing bad data
- Cycle detection threshold changed from magic number `100` to named constant `maxVisits = 50` in internal runtime
- Error message when a node routes to an unknown node now includes actionable hint: `"did you call flow.Add()?"`
- Addressed test and build issues introduced during the sync and example additions; ensure module builds and examples run as tests

### Added

- `Context.Bool(key)` — convenience accessor for bool values
- `Context.Int(key)` — convenience accessor for int values
- `Context.Float(key)` — convenience accessor for float64 values
- `NewNode` panics immediately with a clear message if called with empty `id` or nil `NodeFunc`
- `Flow.Add` panics immediately with a clear message if called with a nil node
- Full unit test suite — 33 tests covering Node, Flow, Engine, Context, KnowledgeStore, and knowledge injection
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file
- `examples/conversational` — interactive conversational demo showing how to use `KnowledgeStore` and `Engine` (REPL)
- `example_pkg_test.go` — `Example` tests so pkg.go.dev can display runnable examples for `Flow`, `KnowledgeStore`, and `Engine`+`Knowledge`
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run `gofmt` check, `go vet`, and `go test` on PRs and pushes

### Changed

- Godoc polish across all public types: `Node`, `Flow`, `Engine`, `Context`, `Result`, `KnowledgeUnit`, `KnowledgeStore`
- `Result` docs now clearly explain the priority of `Next` vs graph Links
- `Flow.Link` docs clarify that duplicate links are silently ignored (first call wins)
- `Engine.Run` docs clarify nil Context behaviour and concurrent safety
- Internal `executor.go` algorithm comment updated to match actual implementation
- Added more and clearer examples to package documentation to improve discoverability on pkg.go.dev

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-02-25

### Added

- `Node` — atomic reasoning unit with `id` and `NodeFunc`. Panics on empty id or nil fn
- `Flow` — directed weighted graph of nodes. Fluent API: `Add()`, `Link()`, `Entry()`
- `Engine` — execution engine. `Run(flow, ctx)` walks the flow and returns a `Result`
- `Context` — typed key-value map passed through every node during execution
- `Result` — output of node/flow execution: `Value`, `Confidence`, `Next`
- `KnowledgeStore` — domain-scoped knowledge shelf. `Add()`, `Get()`, `Domain()`, `Size()`
- `KnowledgeUnit` — atomic piece of knowledge with structured `Facts` and a `Weight`
- `illygen.Knowledge(ctx)` — retrieves the `KnowledgeStore` injected by the engine
- `examples/intent` — full intent-detection REPL demonstrating the complete v0.1 API
- `internal/graph` — private weighted graph (adjacency list, O(1) add, O(E) walk)
- `internal/runtime` — executor: entry-point resolution, cycle detection (maxVisits=50), error propagation
- `go.mod` at `github.com/leraniode/illygen`, `go 1.22`
